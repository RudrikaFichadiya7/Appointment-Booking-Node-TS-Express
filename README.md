Sure, here's a sample README.md file for the appointment booking application:

---

# Appointment Booking System

This is a simple appointment booking system built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript and MongoDB. Users can create appointments, view their appointments, and admins can manage appointments and users.

## Installation and Setup


1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Appointment-Booking-System
   ```

2. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables: 
   - Shared an ENV file for the reference.
   - Defined environment variables such as `PORT`, `MONGODB_URI`, etc.

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. If the system does not have Typescript globally installed:

   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```
6. Compile the TypeScript code:

  ```bash
    npm run build
   ```

7. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

8. For development, we can use:

    ```bash
        npm run dev
    ```
9. Please find .env file for the pre-defined user credentials for Admin,
   Also have added to the user's collection as a initial document as there is no such auth mechanism included.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /appointments**: Retrieve all appointments.
- **POST /appointments**: Create a new appointment.
- **GET /appointments/search**: Retrieve a appointment by search.

- **GET /users**: Retrieve all users.
- **POST /users**: Create a new user.
- **GET /users/search**: Retrieve a user by search.
- **PUT /users/:id**: Update a specific user's status by ID.

## Authentication and Authorization

- Authentication is currently implemented using a basic email and password combination.
- Admins have access to additional functionalities such as managing appointments and users.

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

- **Security**: This application uses a simple email and password authentication mechanism. In a real-world scenario, will prefer to use more secure authentication methods such as JWT or OAuth and RBAC (Role Base Access Control).
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and error handling are minimal in this application. In a production-ready system, robust data validation and error handling will be required, and for the third party app we can go for Joi validation library.
- **Scalability**: The application architecture may need to be revised for scalability. For example, load balancing, and database sharding for larger scale deployments.
- **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests are not included in this sample. In practice, thorough testing would be necessary to ensure application reliability using some third-party libraries like JEST.

## Future Possible Improvements

- Implement more secure authentication mechanisms such as JWT or OAuth.
- Enhance input validation and error handling for better user experience.
- Implement unit tests and integration tests for improved reliability.
- Add features such as OTP verification, email notifications, calendar integration, etc.

## Running Out of Time

Due to time constraints, certain features and best practices may have been omitted or simplified in this sample application. Given more time, I would focus on enhancing security along with the perfect search in Appointment searching & sorting data, implementing thorough testing, and refining the user experience.
